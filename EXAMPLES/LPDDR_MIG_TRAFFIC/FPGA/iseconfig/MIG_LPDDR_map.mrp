    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        64 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          473
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           241 out of     473   50%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  92 out of     473   19%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             100 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network c1_p0_cmd_byte_addr<29> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 4 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   c1_p0_cmd_byte_addr<28>,
   c1_p0_cmd_byte_addr<27>,
   c1_p0_cmd_byte_addr<26>,
   c1_p0_cmd_byte_addr<0>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
